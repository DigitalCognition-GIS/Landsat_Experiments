> Relevant quote from the PDF ( source cited above ) - The bit-packed information in aQA band is adecimal translation of binary strings. Forexample, the decimal value “1” translates to the binary value “0001.” The binary value “0001” has 4 bits(0, 1, 2, and 3),written right to left as bits 0 (“1”), 1 (“0”), 2 (“0”), and 3 (“0”). Each of the bits 0-3 represents a condition that can affect the calculation of a physical value. Bit 0 may be used to identify fill values, bit 1 may be used to identify a cloud, bit 2 may be used to indicate water, and bit 3 may be used identify snow. If the condition is true, the bit is set to “1,” and “0” if false.
